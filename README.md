Equations which are composed of an unknown function and its derivatives are called differential equations.
Differential equations play a fundamental role in engineering because many physical phenomena are best formulated mathematically in terms of their rate of change.
In numerical analysis, predictorâ€“corrector methods belong to a class of algorithms designed to integrate ordinary differential equations- to find an unknown function that satisfies a given differential equation.
In mathematics, particularly numerical analysis, a predictor-corrector method is an algorithm that proceeds in two steps.
1. First, the prediction step calculates a rough approximation of the desired quantity.
2. Second, the corrector step refines the initial approximation using another means.
